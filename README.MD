## 💡 Problem Statement

Modern healthcare demands fast, accurate, and accessible diagnosis methods. However, challenges such as:

- Time constraints,
- Need for expert interpretation,
- And the growing workload on medical professionals

often hinder the diagnostic process.

This project aims to solve these issues by enabling **AI-assisted image analysis**, offering a reliable second opinion and reducing the dependency on manual review.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a **Visual Medical Assistant** web application that:

- 🖼️ Accepts uploaded **medical images** (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans).
- 🔍 Uses **Google Generative AI** (Gemini Pro or similar) to analyze these images.
- 📄 Provides a **structured medical report** with:
  - Diagnostic insights
  - Potential health concerns
  - Suggested next steps or treatments
- 💬 Displays all output within an interactive **Streamlit** UI.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit  
- **AI Model**: Google Generative AI (via `google.generativeai`)  
- **Image Upload & Processing**: Python PIL / OpenCV (as needed)  
- **Report Generation**: Prompt engineering + AI response formatting  
- **Environment Management**: python-dotenv  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User uploads** a medical image through the web UI.
2. The app **preprocesses** the image if necessary (resize, encode).
3. It generates a **diagnostic prompt** and sends it to the Generative AI model.
4. The AI **analyzes** the image context and returns:
   - Observations
   - Risk indicators
   - Suggested actions
5. The **report is displayed** in a structured and user-friendly format.
6. (Optional) The report can be exported or saved.
